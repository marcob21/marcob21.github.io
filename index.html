	<h4>About Me:</h4>
	<p>I like to play a lot of video games even though it's bad for me.
I also have a substantial amount of birds that all are parakeets.
I think I spend too much time on youtube.
I am from the Bronx but my parents are both Mexican.
What I enjoy doing is being lazy and talking with my friends and family.
I am currently a senior attending the school , Bronx Early Academy for Teaching and Learning
I am able to speak spanish and english but english is my main language
I also like to do some graphic designing for things like Youtube.</p>
